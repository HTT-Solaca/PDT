# PD_TOL

**PD_TOL** is a lightweight Python decorator that provides error-tolerant processing for pandas DataFrame operations. It helps prevent code from breaking due to row-level issues in real-world datasets, automatically skipping rows that would otherwise cause exceptions.

> Ideal for robust data pipelines, quick experimentation, and processing messy data.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Seamlessly skips problematic rows in `pandas.DataFrame` operations  
- ⚡ Minimal overhead on clean data  
- 🛠️ Works with functions that return modified DataFrames or operate in-place  
- 🧪 Ideal for exploratory data analysis and production scenarios alike
